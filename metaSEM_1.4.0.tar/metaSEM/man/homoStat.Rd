\title{Test the Homogeneity of Effect Sizes
}
\description{It tests the homogeneity of univariate and multivariate effect sizes.
}
\usage{
homoStat(y, v)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{A vector of effect size for univariate meta-analysis or a \eqn{k}{k} x
	\eqn{p}{p} matrix of effect sizes for multivariate meta-analysis
	where \eqn{k}{k} is the number of studies and \eqn{p}{p} is the
	number of effect sizes. 
}
  \item{v}{A vector of the sampling variance of the effect size for univariate
	meta-analysis or a \eqn{k}{k} x \eqn{p*}{p*} matrix of the sampling
	covariance matrix of the effect sizes for multivariate meta-analysis
	where \eqn{p* = p(p+1)/2 }{p* = p(p+1)/2}. It is arranged by column
	major as used by \code{\link[OpenMx]{vech}}. It is assumed that
	there is no missing value in \code{v} if \code{y} is complete. If there are missing values in \code{v}
	due to the missingness on \code{y}, the missing values in
	\code{v} will be removed automatically.
}
}

\value{A list of
  \item{Q}{Q statistic on the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effect
	sizes. It has an approximate chi-square distribution under the null
	hypothesis.}
  \item{Q.df}{Degrees of freedom of the Q statistic}
  \item{pval}{p-value on the test of homogeneity of effect sizes}
}
