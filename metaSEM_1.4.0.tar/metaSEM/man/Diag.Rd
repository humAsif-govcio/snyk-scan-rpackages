\title{Matrix Diagonals
}
\description{Extract or replace the diagonal of a matrix, or construct a diagonal matrix with the same behaviors as \code{diag} prior to R-3.0.0.
}
\usage{
Diag(x, ...)
Diag(x) <- value
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A matrix, vector or 1D array, or missing.}
  \item{...}{Optional dimensions (\code{nrow} and \code{ncol}) for the result when \code{x} is
    not a matrix.}
  \item{value}{Either a single value or a vector of length equal to that
    of the current diagonal. Should be of a mode which can be coerced
    to that of \code{x}.}
}

\details{Started from R-3.0.0, \code{diag(x)} returns a numeric matrix with NA in the
  diagonals when x is a character vector. Although this follows what the manual says, this
  breaks the metaSEM. The \code{Diag} has the same functions as
  \code{diag} except that \code{Diag(x)} works for a character vector of
  x by returning a square matrix of character "0" with \code{x} as the
  diagonals.
