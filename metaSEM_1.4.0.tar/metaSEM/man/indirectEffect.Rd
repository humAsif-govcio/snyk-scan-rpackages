\title{Estimate the asymptotic covariance matrix of standardized or unstandardized indirect and direct effects
}
\description{It estimates the standardized or unstandardized indirect and direct effects
  and their asymptotic sampling covariance matrix.
}
\usage{
indirectEffect(x, n, standardized = TRUE, direct.effect = TRUE, run = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A 3x3 correlation/covariance matrix or a list of
	correlation/covariance matrices. Variables are
	arranged as the dependent variable (y), mediator (m) and independent
	variable (x)
}
  \item{n}{Sample size or a vector of sample sizes
  }
  \item{standardized}{Logical. Whether the indirect effect is
  standardized.
}
  \item{direct.effect}{Logical. Whether the direct effect is
  estimated. If it is \code{FALSE}, the direct effect is fixed at zero.
}
  \item{run}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, only return the mx model without running the analysis.}
}
\details{Cheung (2009) estimated the standardized indirect effect and
  its standard error with non-linear constraints. Since \code{OpenMx} does not generate standard errors when there
  are non-linear constraints, Kwan and Chan's (2011) approach is used in
  this function. Delta method is used to calculate the asymptotic covariance matrix.
}
\value{A vector (or a matrix if the input is a list of matrices) of
  (standardized) indirect effect, standardized direct effect, and their
  asymptotic sampling covariance matrices

## A correlation matrix as input

dimnames(x) <- list( c("y", "m", "x"), c("y", "m", "x") )

## A list of correlation matrices
